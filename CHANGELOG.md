# Changelog

All notable changes to the Spore firmware are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).

## [Unreleased]
- First tagged release: multi-mode synth / granular / generative firmware with the
  shared modulation engine, tempo-synced delay + MIDI clock, and analog-sensor input.
- USB device name: the pedal now enumerates as **"Spore"** (manufacturer "rainybit")
  instead of "Daisy Seed Built In", via a vendored `src/usb_identity.c` descriptor
  override. VID/PID kept at the stock Daisy/STM values (a real custom VID/PID is a
  one-line edit there, deferred until productization).
- Public-release prep: GPL-3.0 licensing + SPDX headers, build/release CI, README.

Releasing:  scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z      (or  scripts\release.ps1 vX.Y.Z  on Windows)
  Add your notes under [Unreleased] above, then run that one command: it moves them
  under a dated [vX.Y.Z] heading, commits, tags, and pushes. CI builds
  spore-vX.Y.Z.{bin,hex,elf} and publishes a Release whose body IS this CHANGELOG section.
